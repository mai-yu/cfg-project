            <td>Hi I’m Maryam, I’m from London and I work in Ethical Trade. I was interested in doing the CodeFirst: Girls Course to further my professional skills but also because I’ve always wanted to know how to  build fun, responsive websites. The journey has been exciting, confusing at times, but ultimately, incredibly rewarding! I hope you enjoy our website.</td>
